# Developer Guide

## Acknowledgements

This developer guide follows the suggested format given in [AddressBook-Level3 developer guide](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/DeveloperGuide.html).

## Design
### Architecture
![Architecture diagram](Architecture_diagram.jpg)
The architecture diagram given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is an overview of the main components and how they interact with each other.

### Data component
The data component consists of customers, flight bookings, menu items, routes data as well as exceptions and validity checkers.<br>
The actual data objects are encapsulated in the respective data managers. For example, the list of Customer objects are maintained in the CustomerManager object.<br>
In this way, data are encapsulated and decoupled from higher layers.
Manipulation of data can only be performed through data managers to ensure data integrity.

### Command component
Command class is an abstract class, which is then extended as specific commands such as BookCommand and AddRouteCommand.<br>
Each command interacts with data managers to create, retrieve, delete or modify data.<br>
This design makes use of polymorphism, such that duplication is avoided and the functionalities can be easily expanded.

### Parser component
Parser component consists of a general parser and dedicated parsers for customers data and flight bookings respectively. <br>
The parser object takes in user input string, extracts desired information and returns a command object.<br>
The parser class decouples the command class from parsing input. Thus, each class has only one dedicated responsibility.

### Storage component
Each data class has a file manager to handle data storage, such as CustomerFileManager for customer data and RouteFileManager for route data.<br>
The file manager is responsible for decoding, encoding, saving and loading data from text file.

### Common component
Classes used by multiple components are in the `arcs.common` package.
